# Exploring Coffee Quality Data with Power BI

## Project Overview
The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) dataset provides comprehensive information on coffee production, processing, and sensory evaluations. This project aims to analyze various factors influencing coffee quality using Power BI.

### Research Questions
1. What are the key determinants of coffee quality based on sensory attributes?
2. Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?
3. What trends or patterns exist in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality?
4. How do different variables interact to influence Total Cup Points, a measure of overall coffee quality?

### Data Sources
- **Original Dataset:** `df_arabica_clean.csv`
- **Power BI Report:** `CQI_Analysis_Report.pbix`

### Methodologies and Tools
- Data exploration and visualization using Power BI
- Analysis of sensory evaluations including aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.
- Correlation analysis, trend identification, and pattern recognition

### Key Findings
- Insights into factors influencing coffee quality scores
- Correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and sensory attributes
- Impact of defects on overall coffee quality

### Visuals and Documentation
- Include visualizations from Power BI directly in this repository.
- Documentation on how to interpret the visualizations and insights generated.
